        <h2>Heart Rate</h2>
        <p>Heart rate measures the number of times the heart beats per minute. It's a crucial indicator of cardiovascular health and fitness. An abnormally high heart rate (tachycardia) or low heart rate (bradycardia) may indicate underlying health conditions such as heart disease, dehydration, stress, or hormonal imbalances.</p>
            <sub>Actions to Take:</sub><p>If heart rate is too high: Rest, relax, and practice deep breathing techniques. Ensure hydration and avoid stimulants like caffeine.
            If heart rate is too low: Evaluate for signs of bradycardia, such as dizziness or fainting. Seek medical attention if necessary.

        <h2>Blood Oxygen</h2>
        <p> Blood oxygen level (SpO2) measures the percentage of oxygen saturated hemoglobin in the blood. Adequate oxygenation is essential for normal cellular function, and low oxygen levels (hypoxemia) can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.</p>
        <sub>Actions to Take:</sub><p>If blood oxygen level is too low: Ensure proper ventilation and oxygenation. Seek medical attention if hypoxemia persists or worsens.

    <!-- Third Information Area -->
    <section class="info-area">
        <h2>Hydration</h2>
        <p>Hydration status refers to the balance of fluid in the body. Adequate hydration is essential for regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients, and removing waste products. Dehydration can impair physical and cognitive function and lead to serious health complications.</p>
        <sub>Actions to Take:</sub><p>If dehydrated: Drink fluids, preferably water or electrolyte solutions, to rehydrate. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can exacerbate dehydration. Seek medical attention if dehydration is severe.
        </p>

    <!-- Fourth Information Area -->
    <section class="info-area">
        <h2>Blood Pressure</h2>
        <p>Systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. It reflects the force exerted by the heart to pump blood throughout the body. Elevated systolic blood pressure (hypertension) can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other complications.</p>
        <sub>Actions to Take:</sub><p>If systolic blood pressure is too high: Adopt lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, reducing sodium intake, managing stress, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and management, which may include medication.
